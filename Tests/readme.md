# Tests

This part of the project is designed to test if the Extension is working as expected. The tests are written in TypeScript and uses Playwright to interact with the Extension in E2E tests.

# How to use it

1. Install the dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

2. Run the tests

```bash
npm playwright test
```

- or if you want to see the browser while the tests are running

```bash
npm playwright test --ui
```
